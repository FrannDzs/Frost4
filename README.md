## Frost4-Toolkit

### InitFS Editor

Allows you to modify the InitFS file located in certain (or all) Frostbite 3 games, the editor was built with Mirror's Edge Catalyst in mind but may work on other games that utilize Frostbite 3.

NOTE: Being able to save changes doesn't mean the game will accept a modified InitFS, you will need to bypass any checks the game potentially has. Frostbite 3 modding tools like Frosty implement a patch that bypasses these checks; on consoles the InitFS can be modified without needing to bypass checks. Also, it is recommended to keep backups of the original InitFS and heavily modified files; my tool will not remember what is modified after you close it or open/reopen an InitFS.

### Editor Info

Update 07/09/2020: The main "Frost4" editor tool is being heavily reworked, the older source code was very unfunctional. The time to rework will vary but the goal is to push out a better tool that is dynamic and user-friendly.

~~Currently very BETA, current purposes are data analysis but the tool can be used to browse the ebx/res filesystem of Frostbite on PS4 specifically for Mirror's Edge Catalyst.~~

~~Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2~~
