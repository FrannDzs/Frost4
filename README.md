## Frost4-Toolkit

### Info

Update 04/18/2020: This tool is being heavily reworked, the older source code was very unfunctional. The time to rework will vary but the goal is to push out a better tool that is dynamic and user-friendly.

~~Currently very BETA, current purposes are data analysis but the tool can be used to browse the ebx/res filesystem of Frostbite on PS4 specifically for Mirror's Edge Catalyst.~~

~~Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2~~
